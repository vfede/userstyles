This style changes Panorama for Firefox 4 and greater.

What this style does:
* Style Tabs, Tab Groups and Tab Favicon to look sharper (no rounded croners, like Metro UI from Microsoft) and with glass background.
* Hide AppTab Tray Container in all groups
* Show Close Tab Button only on hover

##Credits
This style was inspired by and is based on http://userstyles.org/styles/43654/panorama-clean-and-glass

Thanks goes to the author of that style, without that this style can't exists.
