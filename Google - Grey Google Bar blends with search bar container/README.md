==========
![Style Preview](cdn.userstyles.org/style_screenshots/62844_after.png)

This style for Firefox changes the following in ALL Google's services:
* The Google Bar is grey instead of black, it perfectly blends with the grey search bar container beneath.
* The text colors change on hover.

It works in every Google service (not only Google Plus)!
It works better with the latest Google Bar as shown in the screenshot.
Some support for older black bar too.

If the style does not work, manually add your country domain (e.g. google.xx) to the domain list.
